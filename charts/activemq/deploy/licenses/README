# Dependency Licenses

This directory contains license files of projects that the artemiscloud operator
project depends on.

Each license file should be named in the following pattern:

LICENSE-[go module name].txt

If [go module name] contains forward slashes(/) they should be replaced with
hyphens. For example the license file name for module software.sslmate.com/src/go-pkcs12
should be:

LICENSE-software.sslmate.com-src-go-pkcs12.txt
